# Peer-Assessment 1 For Reproducible Research

To my peers:

The answers to the questions for the first assignment are in the code that I produced in the "jim's submission file" here in the directory.   I did not prepare it in R Markdown and compile properly.  I have included charts and graphs after the fact for my own edification and practice. 

I am also continuing to learn how to use Git and Github properly so that future submissions are cleaner.

Thanks for reading!

Jim
